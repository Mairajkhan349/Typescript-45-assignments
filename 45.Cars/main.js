//Assignment No :- 45
// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

    let carObj = {
        Manufacturer: manufacturer,
        Model: model,
        ...Object.assign({}, ...rest),
    };
    return carObj;
